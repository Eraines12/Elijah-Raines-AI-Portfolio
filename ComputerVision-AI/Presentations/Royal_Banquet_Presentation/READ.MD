## 📘 Overview  
This project presents different digital image formats as a creative "Royal Banquet," where each file type is represented as a unique dish. The purpose was to compare image formats in a fun and memorable way while learning about compression, transparency, storage, and use cases.  

Our goal was to show how each format serves a different purpose—just like different dishes serve different tastes.

## 🍽️ The Royal Banquet Menu of Image Formats  

### **1. JPEG – Appetizer: JPEG Sliders**  
- Light, compressed, and easy to share.  
- Removes some detail to reduce size.  
- Great for photos and web images.  
- Fun Fact: **JPEG = Joint Photographic Experts Group**.  


---

### **2. PNG – Soup Course: PNG Gazpacho**  
- Crisp, refreshing, and fully preserved.  
- Lossless compression.  
- Supports transparency (alpha channel).  
- Ideal for logos, UI graphics, and transparent images.  


---

### **3. BMP – Main Course: BMP Beef Brisket**  
- Full detail, unprocessed, zero compression.  
- Very large file size.  
- Best for raw image storage and technical uses.  
- Like brisket: “hearty and classic.”  


---

### **4. TIFF – Dessert: TIFF Chocolate Mousse Tower**  
- Rich, layered, and highly customizable.  
- Can be lossless or lossy depending on settings.  
- Supports multiple images in one file (like hidden layers).  
- Used in professional workflows and archiving.

## 🎯 What We Learned  
- Different image formats serve different purposes depending on quality, file size, and transparency needs.  
- Compressed formats like **JPEG** save space but lose detail.  
- Lossless formats like **PNG** keep quality but are larger.  
- **BMP** stores raw image data and is extremely large.  
- **TIFF** is flexible and widely used in professional environments like photography and publishing.  
- Presenting technical information creatively helps make concepts easier to understand.

## ✅ Summary  
This project helped us understand the strengths and weaknesses of major image formats while practicing teamwork, research, and creative communication. Each format brings something unique to the "banquet," just like tools in computer vision.
