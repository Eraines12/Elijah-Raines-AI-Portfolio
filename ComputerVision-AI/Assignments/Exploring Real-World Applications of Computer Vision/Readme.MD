Lab 01: Exploring AR & VR in Medical Computer Vision
📌 Overview

This lab explores how Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are used in the medical field through computer vision. The focus is on how AR/VR improves surgical accuracy, reduces risks, and enhances training.

🧠 What I Researched

I looked into how AR & VR headsets—like Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap, and other surgical AR devices—help surgeons by displaying semi-transparent overlays of medical data directly into their real-world view.
These overlays come from medical scans such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound, which are converted into 3D models.

🔧 Key Components of AR/VR Medical Systems

Tracking & Localization Sensors
Cameras or depth sensors map the operating room in 3D.

Computer Vision Registration Engine
Aligns real patient anatomy with 3D digital models.

Visualization Software
Shows measurements, surgical tools, and hidden structures.

3D Medical Data Sources
Pre-operative scans that become 3D organs, vessels, or tumors.

✅ Benefits

Higher surgical accuracy

Reduced surgery time and fewer complications

Better training for medical students

Improved visualization of anatomy without extra incisions

-----

⚠️ Challenges

Very high cost of equipment

Training required to use AR/VR effectively

Not all surgeries have perfect AR/VR datasets or algorithms

Uncertainty about performance on complex cases (e.g., cancer, heart surgery)
