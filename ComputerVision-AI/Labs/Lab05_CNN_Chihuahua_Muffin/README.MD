📌 Overview

This lab focused on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of chihuahuas vs. muffins. CNNs are designed to detect edges, textures, and shapes, which makes them effective for computer vision tasks.

🛠 What I Did

Built a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.

Trained the model for 10 epochs and reached around 90% validation accuracy.

Used data augmentation to reduce overfitting.

Tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of layers.

Compared the CNN to a basic neural network.

📚 What I Learned

CNNs work better than standard neural networks for image tasks.

Data augmentation helps improve generalization.

Hyperparameter tuning affects accuracy and training speed.

Some images are difficult to classify because chihuahuas and muffins can look very similar.

CNNs are used in real-world applications like healthcare, security, and self-driving cars.
