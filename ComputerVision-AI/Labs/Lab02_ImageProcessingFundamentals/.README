# Lab 02 – Image Processing Fundamentals

## Overview
This lab introduced the basics of how computers process and understand images. I learned how images are represented as numerical arrays and how different operations can change the way an image looks.

## What I Did
- Explored how pixel values and RGB channels represent an image.
- Applied simple image transformations such as resizing, rotating, and flipping.
- Used filters to highlight edges and textures.
- Viewed histograms to understand brightness and contrast in images.
- Observed how small changes in pixel values affect the final image.

## What I Learned
- Images are stored as matrices of numbers, not pictures.
- Filters and transformations are math operations applied to pixel groups.
- Histograms show the distribution of pixel intensity.
- Each image channel (R, G, B) contributes differently to the final color.
- Image processing is the foundation of computer vision and AI models.

## Challenges
- Some filters produced unexpected results and took time to understand.
- Understanding how pixel math creates visual effects was tricky at first.
- Keeping track of image shape and channels required attention.
