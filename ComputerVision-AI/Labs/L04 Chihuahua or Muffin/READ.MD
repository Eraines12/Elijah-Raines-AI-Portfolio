Lab 04: Chihuahua vs. Muffin Classifier (PyTorch)

L04_ElijahRaines_ITAI_1378 (1)_3

📌 Overview

This lab focused on building a PyTorch image classifier that can tell the difference between chihuahuas and muffins. The project helped me understand how neural networks read images, how data must be prepared, and how training actually works.

🛠️ What I Did

📁 Formatted the image data correctly for PyTorch (height × width × channels).

🔧 Built a neural network with a forward pass to process images.

⚡ Enabled GPU support for faster training.

🖼️ Loaded and visualized training and validation data.

🔄 Used transforms to convert images into tensors.

📦 Created DataLoaders for batching and shuffling.

🎯 Trained the model using a loss function and optimizer across multiple epochs.

📚 What I Learned

🧩 Neural networks process images step by step through layers.

🖥️ GPUs make training much faster because they handle parallel operations.

🔄 Transforms and DataLoaders are required for handling image data correctly.

📉 Loss functions and optimizers work together to improve predictions.

🧠 Even a simple classifier requires many steps to work properly.

🚗 These methods apply to real-world tasks like self-driving cars, medical imaging, and photo recognition.
