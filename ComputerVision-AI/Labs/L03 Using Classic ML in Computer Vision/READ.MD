Lab 03: Classical Machine Learning for Computer Vision
Overview

This lab focused on applying classical machine learning methods to the Olivetti Faces dataset. The goal was to understand how feature extraction works and how to train models that avoid overfitting.

What I Did

Used the Olivetti Faces dataset (64×64 grayscale images).

Extracted features using HOG, LBP, and raw pixels.

Trained SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes models.

Compared training vs. validation accuracy to check for overfitting.

What I Learned

HOG and LBP features work better than raw pixels.

High training accuracy does not mean the model is good.

Validation accuracy is the best indicator of true performance.

Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data.
