# Machine Learning - AI

This repository contains all labs and assignments completed for my Machine Learning coursework in the Applied AI & Robotics Program at Houston Community College.

Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience working with real datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive machine learning models using Python, Scikit-Learn, and modern data science tools.
