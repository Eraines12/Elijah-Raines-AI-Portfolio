# Lab 02 – Full Machine Learning Workflow (Wine Dataset)

## 📘 Overview
This lab walked through a complete machine learning workflow using the **Wine Quality dataset**. The goal was to practice every major step in the ML pipeline — from loading data and preprocessing it to training, evaluating, and comparing multiple models.

## 🔍 What I Did
### **1. Loaded and Inspected the Dataset**
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
- Identified features (X) and the target label (y)  
- Explored the dataset shape, distribution, and column types  

### **2. Data Preparation**
- Scaled and standardized features for better model performance  
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets  
- Ensured reproducibility with consistent random states  

### **3. Model Training**
Trained and compared two machine learning models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

Each model was fitted using the prepared training data.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
Evaluated both models using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

These metrics helped identify which model performed better and why.

### **5. Model Comparison**
Compared both models side-by-side and reviewed why certain models worked better on this dataset.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Through this lab, I learned:
- How to build a complete machine learning pipeline from start to finish  
- Why preprocessing (such as scaling) is essential for some models  
- How different models behave on the same dataset  
- How to interpret confusion matrices and classification reports  
- How to evaluate models using more than just accuracy  

This lab helped strengthen my understanding of how machine learning models are developed and tested in real-world workflows.

## ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
Some of the challenges included:
- Understanding which preprocessing steps each model requires  
- Interpreting evaluation metrics beyond accuracy  
- Deciding how to tune model parameters to improve results  

Working through these challenges helped me gain confidence in applying ML techniques to real datasets.
