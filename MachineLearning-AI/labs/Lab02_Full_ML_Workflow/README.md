# Lab 02 – Full Machine Learning Workflow (Wine Dataset)

## 📘 Overview
This lab walks through an entire machine learning pipeline using the classic **Wine dataset**. The goal was to practice loading data, preparing features, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance using real metrics.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed
### **1. Loaded & inspected dataset**
- Identified features (X) and labels (y)  
- Checked dataset shape and structure  

### **2. Data Preparation**
- Converted data into Pandas DataFrame  
- Normalized/standardized features  
- Created train/test split  

### **3. Model Training**
Trained two major ML models:
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

### **4. Evaluation Metrics**
Used Scikit-Learn to compute:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  

### **5. Model Comparison**
Logged results and compared which model performed best on this dataset.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Training multiple machine learning models  
- Using evaluation metrics correctly  
- Understanding strengths and weaknesses of classifiers  
- Proper experiment documentation  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib
