# Midterm Project – Data Storytelling  
### ITAI 1371: Introduction to Machine Learning  
### Elijah Raines

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to practice **data storytelling** — exploring data, creating visualizations, building models, and explaining insights in a clear and meaningful way.

The goal was to understand patterns in the data and show how different features affect survival outcomes.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Data

### **Passenger Class**
- 1st-class passengers had the highest survival rate.
- 3rd-class passengers had the lowest chance of survival.
- Class was one of the strongest predictors of survival.

### **Age Patterns**
- Adults between 20–35 had higher survival rates.
- Children and older adults showed lower survival.
- Age had a small negative correlation with survival.

### **Gender**
- Females survived at a much higher rate than males.
- This trend was consistent across all classes.

These visual patterns formed the core “story” of how survival differed across groups.

## 🛠 Data Preparation
- Filled missing **Age** values using the median.
- Converted **Sex** into numeric values.
- One-hot encoded the **Embarked** column.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## 🤖 Models Used

### **1. Logistic Regression**
- Accuracy: **81%**
- Served as a simple baseline model.

### **2. Random Forest Classifier**
- Accuracy: **81%**
- Better balance between precision and recall.
- More stable predictions across survival groups.

- Skill in creating meaningful visualizations  
- Understanding of ML workflows  
- Ability to communicate insights clearly  
- Hands-on experience training classification models
