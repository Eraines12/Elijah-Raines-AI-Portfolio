### **1. Machine Learning Workflow**
- Problem definition  
- Data collection  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model selection  
- Training the model  
- Evaluating performance  
- Deployment (conceptual)

### **2. Types of Learning**
- **Supervised Learning**  
  - Classification  
  - Regression  
- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  - Clustering  
  - Dimensionality reduction  
- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Agent, environment, rewards  

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
