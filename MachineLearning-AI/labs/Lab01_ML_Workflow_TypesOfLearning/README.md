# Lab 01 – Machine Learning Workflow & Types of Learning

## 📘 Overview
This lab introduced the foundational ideas behind Machine Learning. I learned how the ML workflow operates from start to finish and explored the major types of learning used in real-world applications. This lab helped me build the vocabulary and understanding needed to complete later labs and assignments.

## 🔍 What I Did
### **1. Studied the Machine Learning Workflow**
I walked through each step of the ML pipeline, including:
- Defining the problem  
- Collecting and preparing data  
- Selecting an appropriate model  
- Training the model  
- Evaluating its performance  
- Understanding conceptual deployment  

### **2. Explored Three Types of Learning**
I reviewed the core categories of ML:
- **Supervised Learning** (classification & regression)  
- **Unsupervised Learning** (clustering & dimensionality reduction)  
- **Reinforcement Learning** (agents, environments, and rewards)

### **3. Practiced Identifying ML Components**
I practiced identifying:
- Feature variables (inputs)  
- Target variables (outputs)  
- Which learning type fits which scenario

## 🧠 What I Learned
- A clear step-by-step understanding of how ML models are built and tested  
- The key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning  
- Why data preparation is often the most important part of ML  
- How machine learning relates to real-world tasks like spam detection, recommendation systems, and game-playing agents  

This lab gave me the foundation I needed before working with actual datasets in later labs.

## ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
- Understanding how different learning types apply to different problem scenarios  
- Getting familiar with ML terms like “features,” “labels,” and “model generalization.”  
- Visualizing how the workflow connects from data collection all the way to deployment  

These challenges helped me strengthen my conceptual understanding before writing code.
