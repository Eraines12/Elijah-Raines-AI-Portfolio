# Cancer Vaccine Report  
### Machine Learning - AI
### Elijah Raines

## 📘 Overview
This assignment explored how machine learning concepts relate to the development of Russia’s mRNA cancer vaccine. The focus was on understanding how data, modeling, and experimentation contribute to vaccine research and how this differs from the U.S. approach.

## 🔍 Key Ideas from the Report

### **1. Data Used in Vaccine Development**
You explained that Russia likely trained the vaccine using:
- Medical data from living and deceased patients  
- Patient factors such as age, weight, and cancer type  
- Long-term observation of tumor mutations

This reflects how machine learning models rely on diverse datasets to learn patterns.

### **2. Machine Learning Concepts Connected to Vaccines**
Your report compared vaccine development to ML workflows:
- Continuous testing = iterative model training  
- Trial and error = tuning and improving algorithms  
- Detecting tumor cells = classification problem  
- Deep learning required to understand biological responses

### **3. Russia vs. USA Vaccine Approach**
You highlighted several differences:
- Russia plans to offer the mRNA cancer vaccine **for free**  
- The U.S. faces challenges such as:
  - Public distrust (similar to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy)  
  - Transportation and supply-chain risks  
  - Risk of stolen or fake vaccines  
  - Uneven medical resources across states
